# Tailwind CSS Responsive Design Conflict Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts: conflicting utility classes across breakpoints.  The bug involves overlapping styles that lead to unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in the interaction between responsive modifiers (`md:`, `lg:`, etc.) and potentially conflicting Tailwind utility classes. When multiple classes with responsive modifiers affect the same element at overlapping breakpoints, the resulting style might not be as expected.  This typically manifests as elements rendering incorrectly, not rendering at all, or behaving unexpectedly in specific viewport sizes.

## Reproduction

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, demonstrating the unexpected layout.  The `bugSolution.html` file presents a solution.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the order of classes and potentially using more specific or overriding selectors to ensure that the styles apply correctly at each breakpoint.  Detailed explanation within the solution file.
