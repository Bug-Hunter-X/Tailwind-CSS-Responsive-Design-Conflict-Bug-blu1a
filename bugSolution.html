The solution involves using Tailwind's specificity rules to ensure that the intended styles are applied at each breakpoint. We can achieve this by reorganizing the classes or by using `@screen` directives within a custom CSS file to override or refine the responsive styles. 

```html
<!-- bugSolution.html -->
<div class="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">Item 1</div>
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">Item 2</div>
  <div class="bg-green-500 p-4">Item 3</div>
  <div class="bg-yellow-500 p-4">Item 4</div>
  <div class="bg-purple-500 p-4">Item 5</div>
  <div class="bg-pink-500 p-4">Item 6</div>
</div>
```
In this solution, the order and specificity of classes prevent conflicting styles.  Ensure that your responsive modifiers are correctly sequenced, and if necessary, use more granular selectors or custom CSS to precisely control layout at each breakpoint.
